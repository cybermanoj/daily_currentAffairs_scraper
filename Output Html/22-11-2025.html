  What are the Key Provisions of the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021 Struck Down by the SC?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Minimum Age of 50 Years for Appointment:
  </b>
  <span>
   Struck down for being
  </span>
  <b>
   arbitrary
  </b>
  <span>
   and excluding competent younger advocates and experts.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     It violated earlier SC rulings that allowed advocates with

    <b>
     10 years of practice

     to be eligible.

   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Four-Year Tenure for Chairpersons and Members:
  </b>
  <span>
   Invalidated it because short tenure undermines
  </span>
  <b>
   judicial independence

     The court directed that

    , which the SC had already invalidated.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <span>
      The Court emphasised that

<h2>
 <span>
  What are Tribunals?

</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   About:
  </b>
  <span>
   Tribunals are
  </span>
  <b>
   quasi-judicial bodies
  </b>
  <span>
   meant to reduce the burden on regular
  </span>
  <b>
   courts
  </b>
  <span>
   and bring technical expertise to specialised disputes.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Constitutional Provision:
  </b>
  <span>
   The

  <b>
   42

  <b>
   nd

  <b>
   Amendment Act of 1976
  </b>
  <span>
   inserted
  </span>
  <b>
   Part XIV-A

  <span>
   into the Constitution of India, which consists of
  </span>
  <b>
   Articles 323A and 323B
  </b>
  <span>
   , providing for the establishment of Tribunals.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Article 323A allows Parliament to set up
    </span>
    <b>
     Administrative Tribunals
    </b>
    <span>
     for
    </span>
    <b>

     Centre, states, local bodies, public corporations and other public authorities.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Article 323B permits Parliament and state legislatures to create tribunals on subjects like taxation, land reforms and industrial disputes.
    </span>
   </li>

<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Key Issues Associated with India's Tribunal System?
 </span>
 <b>
 </b>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Threat to Judicial Independence:
   <span>
    The Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021 gave the Union Government dominant control over
   </span>
   appointments, tenure, salaries and service conditions
   <span>
    of tribunal members.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <span>
      Since the government is the
     </span>
     largest litigant
     <span>
      before tribunals, this executive dominance destroys the requirement of
     </span>
     impartial and independent adjudication
     <span>
      and violates constitutional principles of
     </span>
     judicial independence
     <span>
      , a basic feature of the Constitution.
     </span>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <span>
   </span>
   No Centralised Oversight Mechanism:
   <span>
    Unlike the courts (which have the
   </span>
   <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-judicial-data-grid-1">
    National Judicial Data Grid
   </a>
   <span>
    ), tribunals lack real-time performance statistics.
   </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
     <span>
      Absence of a supervisory body undermines transparency, reform, and evidence-based policymaking.
     </span>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   High Pendency:
  </b>
  <span>
   Several tribunals are burdened with large backlogs. For instance,
  </span>
  <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/79th-foundation-day-of-itat">
   <b>
    Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   alone had Rs 6.7 trillion stuck in disputes (as of 2024), affecting revenue mobilisation and investor confidence.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Chronic vacancies and slow appointments
    </b>
    <span>
     worsen delays, undermining efficiency.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Short Tenure:
  </b>
  <span>
   Tribunal members often
  </span>
  <b>
   serve short with the possibility of reappointment.
  </b>
  <span>
   This increases executive influence, as members may feel pressured to align with the government to secure extensions.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Non-Uniform Procedures:
  </b>
  <span>
   Different tribunals follow different rules, formats and processes. This
  </span>
  <b>
   lack of uniformity leads to inconsistency in justice delivery
  </b>
  <span>
   and creates confusion for litigants.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Overlapping Jurisdictions:
  </b>
  <span>
   In some cases, tribunal powers overlap with those of regular courts. This results in
  </span>
  <b>
   jurisdictional conflicts, delays and confusion
  </b>
  <span>
   about where certain matters should be heard.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
  </b>
  <b>
   Lack of Tribunals-Specific Data and Research:
   <span>
    Tribunals lack a dedicated data and research system, making reforms ad hoc and slow. This gap weakens planning, resource allocation, and evidence-based policy evaluation.
   </span>
  </b>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures can Strengthen India’s India’s Tribunal System?
 </span>
 <b>
 </b>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   National Tribunal Commission:
   <span>
    The Supreme Court directed the Centre to establish a
   </span>
   National Tribunal Commission
   <span>
    as an
   </span>
   essential structural safeguard
   <span>
    to ensure autonomy, transparency, and uniformity in the appointment, administration, and functioning of tribunals.
   </span>
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Leverage Technology:
   <span>
    Expand
   </span>
   e-filing, virtual hearings, digitised records
   <span>
    , and AI-based case management to enhance efficiency and transparency
   </span>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <span>
   </span>
   Streamline Procedures:
   <span>
    Standardise procedural rules across tribunals to ensure uniformity, reduce delays, and improve user experience.
   </span>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Clarify Jurisdictional Boundaries:
  </b>
  <span>
   Avoid overlapping powers between tribunals and courts through clear legislative guidelines to reduce confusion and forum shopping.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Enhance Training &amp; Capacity Building:
  </b>
  <span>
   Provide regular legal and technical training for both judicial and expert members to improve quality and consistency of decisions.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  Conclusion
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <span>
   The Supreme Court’s ruling reinforces that tribunals must function with genuine independence, free from executive influence. Strengthening autonomy through a National Tribunal Commission and standardised procedures is essential for restoring public trust. A reformed tribunal system can deliver faster, fairer and more efficient justice across specialised sectors.

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures are Needed to Reform the Juvenile Justice System in India?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Strengthening Institutional Infrastructure:
  </b>
  <span>
   Mandate
  </span>
  <b>
   timely filling of vacancies
  </b>
  <span>
   in
  </span>
  <b>
   JJBs
  </b>
  <span>
   and
  </span>
  <b>
   CWCs

  <b>
   JJB
  </b>
  <span>
   with a dedicated
  </span>
  <b>
   Legal Services Clinic
  </b>
  <span>
   to provide
  </span>
  <b>
   free legal representation
  </b>
  <span>
   from the start.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Focusing on Rehabilitation and Reintegration:
  </b>
  <span>
   Shift focus from custody to rehabilitation through better
  </span>
  <b>
   vocational training
  </b>
  <span>

  <b>
   education

  <span>
   to ensure successful reintegration and prevent recidivism.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Enhancing Data Transparency:

  <b>
   JJB cases
  </b>
  <span>
   , monitor
  </span>
  <b>
   pendency

  <span>
   with
  </span>
  <b>
   genomics (study of genes)
