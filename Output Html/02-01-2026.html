   Objective: S&amp;L Programme
  </b>
  <span>
   enables
  </span>
  <b>
   informed consumer choice
  </b>
  <span>

   .
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Star Labelling System:
  </b>
  <span>
   A key feature of the programme is the star labelling system, which rates appliances

  <b>
   on a scale of one to five stars based on their energy efficiency.
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Five stars indicating the most energy-efficient product

     , with labels displaying essential information such as star rating, annual energy use, product category, and brand.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Coverage:
  </b>
  <span>
   The programme covers a wide range of household appliances and industrial equipment, with
  </span>
  <b>
   some products brought under mandatory star labelling and others under voluntary labelling,
  </b>
  <span>
   depending on government notifications and market readiness.

    <span>
     Shows
    </span>
    <b>
     1–5 star ratings

 <li>
  <b>
   Dynamic Nature:
  </b>
  <span>
   To keep pace with technological advancements,

  <b>
   BEE periodically revises star rating criteria,
