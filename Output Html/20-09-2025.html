 <span>
  in the Parliament has proposed several measures aimed at

 <b>
  curbing the spread of

<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Key Recommendations to Curb Fake News?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Fact-checking Mechanisms

   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   and an internal
  </span>
  <b>
   ombudsman
  </b>
  <span>
   to oversee editorial content.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Penal Provisions
  </b>
  <span>
   : It suggests amendments to
  </span>
  <b>
   laws to increase fines and hold media accountable for editorial content
  </b>
  <span>
   and discourage the spread of misinformation.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     The panel supports a clear definition of 'fake news' and incorporates it into existing media regulations while ensuring that such efforts do not infringe on freedom of speech or individual rights.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Strengthening the Press Council of India
  </b>
  <span>
   : Create a complaint portal and an independent monitoring body for better oversight
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Regulation of AI-generated Content
  </b>
  <span>
   : Licensing for AI content creators and mandatory labeling of AI-generated material, such as videos, to enhance transparency and reduce the spread of deceptive material.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What is the Need to Curb Fake News?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Threat to Democracy
  </b>
  <span>
   : Fake news can manipulate public opinion, especially during elections, undermining the democratic process.
  </span>

    <span>
     Fake news undermines

  <b>
   Disruption of Public Order
  </b>
  <span>
   : Misinformation can lead to violence and unrest, threatening social stability.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     In 2018, WhatsApp rumors about child kidnappers in India led to mob lynchings across several states, causing deaths and public disorder.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Erosion of Trust
  </b>
  <span>
   : Fake news reduces
  </span>
  <b>
   trust in media and institutions, making it harder for society to make informed decisions.
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     During the Covid-19 pandemic, misinformation regarding vaccines and treatments circulated widely, causing people to
    </span>
    <b>
     question government health guidelines and delaying vaccination efforts.
    </b>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   National Security Risks
  </b>
  <span>
   : Misinformation can destabilize nations and create divisions, posing a security threat.

<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Challenges in Regulating Fake News?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Defining Fake News:
  </b>
  <span>
   Defining what constitutes "fake news" is subjective, there is
  </span>
  <b>
   no universally accepted definition
  </b>
  <span>
   making it difficult to distinguish
  </span>
  <b>
   fake news from opinions, satire, or commentary
  </b>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Freedom of Speech:
  </b>
  <span>
   Excessive regulation risks curbing the
  </span>
  <b>
   fundamental right to free speech under
  </b>
  <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/supreme-court-expands-article-19-ambit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <b>
    Article 19
   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   of the Constitution. Balancing regulation with democratic freedoms is complex.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Rapid Spread on Digital Platforms:
  </b>
  <span>
   Social media enables instant sharing of content, allowing
  </span>
  <b>
   fake news to go viral before fact-checking can occur.
  </b>
  <span>
   This rapid dissemination makes timely intervention difficult.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Many social media platforms are based outside India, creating legal and jurisdictional challenges in enforcement and accountability.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Technological Complexity:
  </b>
  <span>
   AI-generated content, deepfakes, and automated bots can
  </span>
  <b>
   create highly realistic misinformation that is hard to detect.
  </b>
  <span>
   Laws often lag behind these fast-evolving technologies.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     The
    </span>
    <b>
     anonymity provided by the internet
    </b>
    <span>
     allows people to spread false information without accountability. This makes it difficult to trace the originators of fake news and hold them responsible.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Low Digital Literacy:
  </b>
  <span>
   A significant portion of the
  </span>
  <b>
   population lacks the skills to critically evaluate information online,
  </b>
  <span>
   making them more vulnerable to misleading content.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Risk of Government Overreach:
  </b>
  <span>
   Heavy-handed regulation may be perceived as censorship, potentially undermining trust in authorities and media institutions.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Political and Social Polarization:
   <span>
    In politically or socially polarized environments, people may be more likely to accept fake news that aligns with their beliefs, making it harder to regulate and challenge misinformation effectively.
   </span>
  </b>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Robust Mechanism can Strengthen Fake News Regulation in India?
 </span>
 <b>
 </b>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Strengthen Legal and Regulatory Frameworks:
   <span>
    Legislation should precisely
   </span>
   distinguish fake news from opinions,
   <span>
    satire, or dissent to avoid misuse.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Singapore’s criminal laws on misinformation and EU’s self-regulatory code provide insights on balancing regulation and enforcement.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Empower and Institutionalize Fact-Checking:
  </strong>
  <span>
   Fact-checking organizations should be
  </span>
  certified by a central body
  <span>
   , with regular audits to ensure adherence to quality standards.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     The European Fact-Checking Standards Network offers models for transparency and reliability.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Platform Accountability and Regulation:
  </strong>
  <span>
   They must ensure transparency by
  </span>
  disclosing recommendation and amplification algorithms
  <span>
   to prevent the viral spread of false information, as exemplified by the EU Digital Services Act, which mandates platform accountability and swift removal of illegal content.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Additionally, platforms
    </span>
    should clearly label synthetic or AI-generated content to keep users informed
    <span>
     and aware of manipulated or automated material.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Leverage Technology and AI Responsibly:
  </strong>
  <span>
   AI tools can amplify fake news, but with
  </span>
  purpose-built AI tools and human oversight,
  <span>
   it can also mitigate it at scale.
