<h2>
 <span>
  What is the India–Sri Lanka Fishing Dispute?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Location
  </b>
  <span>
   : The dispute centers around the
  </span>
  <b>
   Palk Strait
  </b>
  <span>
   , the narrow body of water separating Tamil Nadu (India) and the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Palk Strait connects the Palk Bay to the Bay of Bengal.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Katchatheevu is a tiny, uninhabited islet in the Palk Strait.
    </b>
    <span>
     The dispute concerns this 285-acre island, which was ceded to Sri Lanka under the
    </span>
    <b>
     1974 Maritime Boundary Agreement.
    </b>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <span>
       While sovereignty is legally settled in
      </span>
      <b>
       Sri Lanka’s favour,
      </b>
      <span>
       Indian fishermen are allowed to visit the islet for drying nets and for religious purposes.
      </span>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Fishing rights
    </b>
    <span>
     remain a separate matter governed by historic practice, international law (
    </span>
    <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/unclos-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
     <b>
      United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982)
     </b>
    </a>
    <span>
     , and bilateral agreements.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Communities involved
  </b>
  <span>
   : Traditional Tamil Nadu fishers and Sri Lanka’s Northern Province fishers have shared these waters for centuries.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Key conflict
  </b>
  <span>
   : Indian mechanised trawlers enter Sri Lankan waters, engaging in
  </span>
  <b>
   bottom trawling
  </b>
  <span>
   , which
  </span>
  <b>
   is banned in Sri Lanka since 2017.
  </b>
  <span>
   This damages coral reefs, shrimp habitats, and depletes fish stocks.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Small-scale artisanal fishers struggle to survive as mechanised trawlers pursue commercial profit, often damaging shared marine resources.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     The conflict is thus both cross-border (India–Sri Lanka) and intra-community (artisanal vs trawler operators in Tamil Nadu).
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   High Seas Issues:
  </b>
  <span>
   Due to depleted fish stocks, Indian fishermen are increasingly venturing into the
  </span>
  <b>
   High Seas
  </b>
  <span>
   , leading to arrests in
  </span>
  <b>
   Maldivian waters
  </b>
  <span>
   and by the
  </span>
  <b>
   British Navy near Diego Garcia
  </b>
  <span>
   for allegedly crossing maritime boundaries.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures Can Address the India–Sri Lanka Fishing Issue and Ensure Sustainable Fisheries?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Distinguish livelihoods: Prioritise artisanal fishers
  </b>
  <span>
   who depend on traditional, sustainable methods.
  </span>
  <b>
   Phase out mechanised bottom trawling,
  </b>
  <span>
   which harms ecosystems and deprives both Indian and Sri Lankan small-scale fishers.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Strengthen cooperation frameworks:
  </b>
  <span>
   Establish an India–Sri Lanka Fisheries Management Council with fisher groups, scientists, and officials.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Use
    </span>
    <b>
     UNCLOS Article 123
    </b>
    <span>
     to guide cooperation in the semi-enclosed Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Consider joint quotas (similar to the
    </span>
    <b>
     Baltic Sea Fisheries Convention’s
    </b>
    <span>
     quota-sharing model), seasonal fishing rights, or regulated fishing days specifically for artisanal fishers.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Invest in alternatives:
  </b>
  <span>
   Promote deep-sea fishing in India’s 200-nautical-mile
  </span>
  <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/india-s-extended-continental-shelf-claim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <b>
    Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   to reduce pressure on near-shore resources.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Provide training, modern vessels, and financial support for fishers to transition away from destructive practices.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Depoliticise Katchatheevu:
  </b>
  <span>
   Accept that sovereignty over Katchatheevu is legally settled under the 1974 Treaty.
  </span>
  <b>
   Debunk myths that it was “gifted” as historical records show Sri Lanka had stronger claims.
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Emphasise that
    </span>
    <b>
     fishing rights are separate from sovereignty and can still be negotiated cooperatively
    </b>
    <span>
     . Use Katchatheevu for
    </span>
    <b>
     joint marine research stations
    </b>
    <span>
     and as a hub for ecological cooperation.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Foster community empathy:
  </b>
  <span>
   Highlight the wartime hardships of Sri Lankan Tamil fishers to build goodwill in Tamil Nadu. Encourage
  </span>
  <b>
   people-to-people ties, recalling Tamil Nadu’s humanitarian support during Sri Lanka’s civil war.
  </b>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  Conclusion
 </span>
</h2>

<p>
 <span>
  The Katchatheevu and Palk Strait issues should b
 </span>
 <b>
  e seen as opportunities for cooperation,
 </b>
 <span>
  not conflict. A
 </span>
 <b>
  fair fisheries regime
 </b>
 <span>
  that protects artisanal livelihoods and ecology is key. Smaller disputes must not overshadow the larger
 </span>
 <b>
  vision of peace and mutual respect in South Asia.

   Isobutanol:
   <span>
    It is a four-carbon alcohol

   (C₄H₁₀O), flammable, colorless,
   <span>
    and traditionally used as a
   </span>
   solvent

   Properties (vs. Ethanol):
  </strong>
  <span>
   Higher energy density than ethanol (closer to diesel).

   <li>
    <span>
     It has lower
