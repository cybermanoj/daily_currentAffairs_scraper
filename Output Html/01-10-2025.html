    Preventive detention
   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   means holding a person
  </span>
  <b>
   not for a crime already committed
  </b>
  <span>
   , but to prevent possible future actions that may threaten public order, security, or essential supplies.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Preventive detention
    </b>
    <span>
     is anticipatory, imposed based on the likelihood of harmful actions in the future, while
    </span>
    <b>
     punitive detention
    </b>
    <span>
     is imposed as punishment after conviction through due legal process.

   <span>
    explicitly permits preventive detention in India. A person can be detained for up to

    <span>
     may prescribe conditions for detention beyond 3 months, set maximum periods, and lay down Advisory Board procedures.

    <span>
     The detained person must be
    </span>
    informed of the grounds of detention

     , though certain facts may be withheld in the public interest.
    </span>
    <ul>
     <li>

 <span>
  What is the National Security Act,1980?
 </span>
 <b>
 </b>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Background:
   <span>
    Preventive detention in India dates back to colonial times, when it was used to curb dissent during wars. After Independence, Parliament enacted the
   </span>
   Preventive Detention Act, 1950
   <span>
    , followed by the
   </span>
   Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 1971
   <span>
    , which was widely misused during the Emergency before being repealed in 1978.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     In
    </span>
    <b>
     1980, the National Security Act (NSA)
    </b>
    <span>
     was introduced. It empowers the Centre, states, District Magistrates, and authorised Police Commissioners to detain individuals to
    </span>
    <b>
     prevent actions
    </b>
    <b>
     “prejudicial to India’s defence, foreign relations, security, public order, or essential supplies.”
    </b>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Detention Orders:
  </b>
  <span>
   A detention order under the NSA functions like a
  </span>
  <b>
   warrant of arrest.
  </b>
  <span>
   Once detained, a person can be held in designated places, moved across states, and subjected to conditions set by the government.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Procedural Requirements:
   <span>
    Grounds of detention must be communicated
   </span>
   within 5 to 15 days
   <span>
    . The detainee can submit a
   </span>
   representation to the government
   <span>
    . An
   </span>
   Advisory Board of High Court judges
   <span>
    must review the case within 3 weeks.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     If the Board finds “no sufficient cause,” the detainee must be released.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Maximum detention period is
    </span>
    12 months
    <span>
     , though it can be revoked earlier.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  Limitations of Safeguards:
  <span>
   Detainees
  </span>
  cannot have legal representation
  <span>
   before the Advisory Board. The government can
  </span>
  withhold certain facts
  <span>
   citing “public interest.” These provisions leave considerable discretion in the hands of authorities, raising concerns about potential misuse.
  </span>
