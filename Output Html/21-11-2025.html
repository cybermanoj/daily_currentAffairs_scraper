   Diet:
  </b>
  <span>
   Dugongs are

  <span>
   feeding primarily on seagrass meadows like
  </span>
  <b>
   Cymodocea, Halophila, Thalassia, and Halodule
  </b>
  <span>
   , earning them the nickname "sea cows" and "farmers of the sea."
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     They require 30-40 kg of seagrass daily for sustenance and live in shallow, warm coastal waters, such as

 <span>
  What are the Challenges and Conservation Measures for the Dugong Population?
 </span>
</h2>

<h2>
 <span>
  Challenges
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Population Decline
  </b>
  <span>
   : The dugong population in Indian waters, once abundant, has
  </span>
  <b>
   significantly declined
  </b>
  <span>
   over the years, with a 2012 report by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change estimating around 200 individuals.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     While some environmentalists estimate the current dugong population to be between 400 and 450, others believe it remains below 250, suggesting
    </span>
    <b>
     little to no substantial increase.
    </b>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Accurately determining the exact number of dugongs in India remains challenging, as they are
    </span>
    <b>
     elusive creatures living in murky coastal waters,
    </b>
    <span>
     where traditional survey methods often fail to provide reliable data.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Pollution
  </b>
  <span>
   : A study published in

  </span>
  <b>

  <span>
   , and

   in the tissues of stranded dugongs, primarily due to

  </b>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Slow Reproductive Rate
  </b>
  <span>
   : Dugongs have a
  </span>
  <b>
   slow reproduction cycle,
  </b>
  <span>
   with females giving birth once every several years, making them more vulnerable to extinction.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Habitat loss: It
  </b>
  <span>
   is a major concern, as
  </span>
  <b>
   seagrass meadows
  </b>
  <span>
   are being destroyed by
  </span>

  </b>
  <span>
   The PDS’s
  </span>
  <b>
   Below Poverty Line (BPL)
  </b>
  <span>
   criteria leave out many vulnerable groups, so
  </span>
  <b>
   12%

  <span>
   This ruling was based on the idea that it allowed violators of environmental laws to circumvent legal requirements, undermining efforts to protect the environment.

<h2>
 <span>
  What are Ex Post Facto Environmental Clearances?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Meaning:
  </b>
  <span>
   Approvals granted after a project has
  </span>
  <b>
   already begun construction,
  </b>
  <span>
   expansion, or operation without obtaining the mandatory
  </span>
  <b>
   prior Environmental Clearance (EC).
  </b>
  <b>
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Purpose:
   <span>
    Intended for rare, exceptional cases but often used to regularise violations by allowing developers to “legalise” work already carried out illegally.
   </span>
  </b>
  <b>
  </b>
 </li>

  <b>

  <ul>

    </span>
    <b>
     “gross illegality” and an “anathema”
    </b>
    <span>
     to environmental jurisprudence, as they
    </span>
    <b>
     violate the precautionary principle
    </b>
    <span>
     that demands environmental harm be prevented before it occurs.
    </span>

     <li>
      <span>

  <b>

  </b>
  <span>
   (through lack of care)

   Many

  What is Environmental Clearance (EC) in India?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   About:
  </b>
  <span>
   EC is a mandatory approval process for certain development and industrial projects in India to ensure that they do not harm the environment or local communities.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     It is a legal requirement under the
    </span>
    <b>
     Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
    </b>
    <span>
     , and is governed primarily by the
    </span>
    <b>
     EIA Notifications of 1994 and 2006
    </b>
    <span>
     .
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Projects That Need EC:
  </b>
  <span>
   Any project located in
  </span>
  <b>
   ecologically sensitive areas
  </b>
  <span>
   (e.g., national parks, biosphere reserves, mangroves, tribal areas, coastal zones) requires EC regardless of category.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     EIA 2006 mandates prior EC for over
    </span>
    <b>
     39 types of activities
    </b>
    <span>
     and classifies
    </span>
    <b>
     projects into Category A
    </b>
    <span>
     (cleared by MoEFCC at the Central level) and
    </span>
    <b>
     Category B
    </b>
    <span>
     (cleared by State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) at State level).
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Core Steps:
   <span>
    The process begins with an EIA study where required, followed by a public hearing to capture community concerns.
   </span>
  </b>
  <b>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     <span>
      Expert committees then appraise the project through reports and site checks before recommending approval or rejection.
     </span>
    </b>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     The final decision is issued within 120 days and the clearance is valid for five years.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Concerns and Limitations:
  </strong>
  <span>
   Public consultation often becomes a procedural formality rather than meaningful participation.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     The EIA process sometimes fails to account for issues raised by local communities.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Recent provisions allow skipping public hearings in “non-conducive situations,” potentially weakening checks and balances.

 </h2>
 <p>
  <b>
   1. What are ex post facto environmental clearances (ECs)?
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ex post facto ECs are approvals granted after a project has already begun without mandatory prior clearance
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   2. Which laws govern ECs in India?
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Environmental Clearance is governed by the
  </span>
  <b>
   Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
  </b>
  <span>
   and
  </span>
  <b>
   EIA Notifications
  </b>
  <span>
   (1994, 2006).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   3. What practical reforms can reduce reliance on retrospective clearances?
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Streamline prior EC processes, strengthen satellite and digital monitoring (PARIVESH/GIS), mandate environmental restoration bonds, enhance timely public hearings, and enforce strict polluter-pays penalties to deter illegal starts.
