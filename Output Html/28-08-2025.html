<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Challenges to Women-Led Development in India?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Social and Safety Constraints:
  </b>
  <span>
   Deep-rooted patriarchy limits decision-making and increases unpaid domestic work.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Early marriage, domestic responsibilities, and threats to
    </span>
    <b>
     personal security
    </b>
    <span>
     (as India records 51 cases of crime against women every hour).
    </span>
    <b>
     curtail mobility, career progression,
    </b>
    <span>
     and active participation in society.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Education and Skill Gaps
  </b>
  <span>
   : Female literacy is
  </span>
  <b>
   65.4% (2011 census)
  </b>
  <span>
   , below the global average, restricting opportunities.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Underrepresentation in Governance &amp; Leadership:
  </b>
  <span>
   Women remain
  </span>
  <b>
   underrepresented in political, corporate, and institutional decision-making
  </b>
  <span>
   , reducing their influence on policies affecting them.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     India's women's representation in the
    </span>
    <b>
     Parliament remains well below the global average of 25%.
    </b>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Digital and Technological Exclusion:
  </b>
  <span>
   Limited access to technology, internet, and digital literacy prevents women from participating fully in the modern economy.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Workforce Participation Barriers:
  </b>
  <span>
   Women face
  </span>
  <b>
   unequal pay, glass ceiling effects, occupational segregation,
  </b>
  <b>
   safety at workplace
  </b>
  <span>
   and limited representation in formal and high-skilled sectors.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures can India Adopt to Further Mainstream Women in Economic Growth?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Childcare &amp; Care Economy:
  </b>
  <span>
   Establish a

  <b>
   National Crèche Grid

  <span>
   , workplace crèches, professionalise care workers, and extend paid maternity leave to informal sectors to enable workforce retention.
  </span>
 </li>

   Infrastructure &amp; Digital Inclusion:

  <span>
   Mandate

   Representation &amp; Governance:

  <span>
   Enforce gender quotas in boards, panchayats, MSME councils; build capacity in
  </span>
  <b>
   gender budgeting
  </b>
  <span>
   ; link incentives to women’s inclusion.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Decentralised Gender Planning:
  </b>
  <span>
   Institutionalize
  </span>
  <b>
   Gender Action Plans at the Gram Panchayat, block, and district levels,
  </b>
  <span>
   incorporating input from Mahila Sabhas and SHG networks. Ensure these plans are co-created with women and integrated into annual development planning and financing.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Workplace Safety and Empowering Women's Mobility:
  </b>
  <span>

   and establish
  </span>
  <b>
