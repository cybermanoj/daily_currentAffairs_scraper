  What are Rare Earth Minerals?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   About:
  </b>
  <span>
   Rare earths are a group of 17 elements including 15 silvery-white metals called lanthanides, or lanthanoids, plus scandium and yttrium.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     In their
    </span>
    <b>
     periodic table order,
    </b>
    <span>
     they are: scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     They are
    </span>
    <b>
     not rare in the sense
    </b>
    <span>
     that they are uncommon. They tend to be spread thin around the Earth's crust in small quantities and mixed together or with other minerals, so larger deposits are difficult to find and costly to extract.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Environmental Impact:
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Processing rare earths often involves the use of solvents, which can produce toxic waste that pollutes the soil, water, and atmosphere.
    </span>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <span>
       More environmentally friendly technologies are being developed, but they are not yet widely used.
      </span>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Certain types of rare earth ores also contain radioactive thorium or uranium, which is often removed using acid.
    </span>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <span>
       For this reason, development of the sector faces health and environmental regulatory hurdles.
      </span>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Use:
  </b>
  <span>
   They are used in a wide range of products including consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), aircraft engines, medical equipment, oil refining, and military applications such as missiles and radar systems.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Biggest Producer:
  </b>
  <span>
   China accounts for about 60% of global mine production and 90% of processed and permanent magnet output.

   Experts call for personal protection, community action, and innovative, cost-effective measures.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  Why are Current Measures Against Aedes Mosquitoes Failing?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Mosquito Behaviour:
  </b>
  <span>
   Aedes mosquitoes
  </span>
  <b>
   bite mainly indoors
  </b>
  <span>
   during the daytime and
  </span>
  <b>
   at night under artificial light
  </b>
  <span>
   . Hence, outdoor fogging miss most of their activity.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Local authorities still conduc
    </span>
    <b>
     t large-scale fumigation,
    </b>
    <span>
     though national health agencies do not recommend it as a routine method. It provides little long-term impact.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Chemical Resistance:
  </b>
  <span>
   Mosquitoes are developing tolerance to
  </span>
  <b>
   pyrethroid-based vaporizers
  </b>
  <span>
   and
  </span>
  <b>
   temephos larvicides
  </b>
  <span>
   , reducing their effectiveness.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   High Cost of New Technologies:
  </b>
  <span>
   Promising innovations like

    Wolbachia mosquitoes
   </b>
  </a>
  <b>
   or spatial repellents
  </b>
  <span>
   remain underused due to high costs and lack of institutional support.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Incomplete Vaccine Protection:

  <span>
   While dengue vaccine trials such as

  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures can Strengthen the Fight Against Aedes Mosquitoes?
 </span>
 <b>
 </b>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Shift Focus from Fogging to Source Reduction:
   <span>
    Fogging kills few mosquitoes because
   </span>
   <i>
    <span>
     Aedes
    </span>
   </i>
   <span>
    rest indoors. The government should prioritise
   </span>
   larval source management
   <span>
    by cleaning stagnant water in homes, rooftops, tyres, and construction sites.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Example:
    </span>
    Delhi’s "10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute"
    <span>
     campaign encourages households to check water containers weekly.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Strengthen Community Participation:
  </strong>
  <i>
   <span>
    Camino Verde trial in Latin America
   </span>
  </i>
  <span>
   showed significant dengue reduction when communities managed breeding sites.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     India can replicate such evidence-based community mobilisation at
    </span>
    ward/village level.
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Like Polio campaigns, India needs a
    </span>
    “Dengue Free India Mission”
    <span>
     combining school education, TV, and digital outreach.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) can be frontline educators for household-level awareness.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Ensure Affordable and Safe Repellents:
  </strong>
  <span>
   Widespread use of
  </span>
  DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide)-based repellents
  <span>
   (proven most effective) should be promoted.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     The government can subsidise or include repellents under

  <b>
   Promote Personal Protection:
   <span>
    Encourage use of long sleeves, treated nets for daytime sleepers, and insecticide-treated school uniforms.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Awareness campaigns must stress that

    <span>

   <li>
    <span>
     Vaccine development should be supported but used cautiously due to limited efficacy.

  <strong>
   Environmental and Waste Management:
  </strong>
  <i>
   <span>
    Aedes
   </span>
  </i>
  <span>
   thrive in plastic waste and discarded containers. India needs stronger

  solid waste management
  <span>
   and plastic recycling initiatives.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Smart cities and Swachh Bharat Mission can integrate anti-dengue waste management drives.
