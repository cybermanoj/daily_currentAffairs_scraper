   Evolution of CSOs in India:
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ancient–Medieval Roots:
    </strong>
    <span>
     Civil society in India has deep roots in the ideas of
    </span>
    dharma (duty), daan (giving), and karma,
    <span>
     which encouraged service to others through religious and social movements.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Pre-Independence Era:
    </strong>
    <span>
     Reformers challenged
    </span>
    caste discrimination, untouchability, and other social evils
    <span>
     , linking voluntary action to social reform.
    </span>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/socio-religious-reform-movement-part-i" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

     </li>
     <li>
      <span>
       Efforts were often
      </span>
      unorganized and relief-based
      <span>
       , but they laid a moral foundation for later mobilization.
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span>
       Gandhi’s philosophy of
      </span>
      self-reliance, upliftment of the poor, and constructive work
      <span>
       inspired mass participation and voluntary service organizations.

   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Post-Independence:

    have raised awareness about women’s rights and promoted political participation.
   </span>

<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Challenges of Civil Society in a Democracy?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Undermining Democratic Values
  </b>
  <span>
   : Not all CSOs pursue democratic purposes, some promote
  </span>
  <b>
   private interests, racism, nationalism, or fundamentalism,
  </b>
  <span>
   undermining democratic values.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Funding Constraints
  </b>
  <span>
   CSOs face financial instability due to limited foreign funding (post
  </span>
  <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/foreign-contribution-regulation-amendment-bill-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <b>
    -FCRA 2020 amendment
   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   ) and inadequate domestic philanthropy.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     State funding can corrupt CSOs, diverting focus from democratic objectives to short-term gains.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Additionally, many CSOs lack effective monitoring systems, making it difficult to assess their impact and attract funding.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Inadequate Government Response
  </b>
  <span>
   : Government agencies may be
  </span>
  <b>
   ill-equipped to handle CSO inputs
  </b>
  <span>
   , resulting in friction, ineffective policymaking, and undermined democratic engagement.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Inadequate Representation
  </b>
  <span>
   : Lack of equal access for marginalized groups in civil society can
  </span>
  <b>
   perpetuate structural inequalities
  </b>
  <span>
   and undermine democratic inclusivity.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Cultural Insensitivity
  </b>
  <span>
   : Global civil society efforts may overlook
  </span>
  <b>
   local cultural contexts,
  </b>
  <span>
   especially in the
  </span>
  <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/global-south-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <b>
    Global South
   </b>
  </a>
  <span>
   , leading to ineffective or irrelevant interventions.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Internal Undemocracy
  </b>
  <span>
   : Many CSOs lack internal democracy, such as transparency or inclusive decision-making, contradicting the democratic principles they advocate.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   External Manipulation
  </b>
  <span>
   : Civil society organizations may be influenced or used by
  </span>
  <b>
   foreign powers to advance political or economic agendas
  </b>
  <span>
   , distorting their role in promoting democracy.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Volunteer Retention
  </b>
  <span>
   : High volunteer turnover and inconsistent engagement make it difficult to sustain long-term projects and community relationships.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures can be Adopted to Enhance the Role of CSO?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Enhance Transparency and Accountability:
  </b>
  <span>
   Develop a
  </span>
  <b>
   national CSO database
  </b>
  <span>
   including financial reports, program outcomes, and impact assessments. Standardized reporting and voluntary third-party audits can build credibility.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Support Evidence-Based Policymaking:
  </b>
  <span>
   Institutionalize CSO involvement in policy through
  </span>
  <b>
   representation on government committees, consultation forums, and the use of CSO data
  </b>
  <span>
   in decision-making.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Diversify Funding Sources:
  </b>
  <span>
   Encourage domestic philanthropy, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) partnerships, and social impact investments to reduce dependency on foreign funds.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Simplify Regulatory Framework:
  </b>
  <span>
   The government could simplify FCRA and streamline CSO registration and compliance through a single-window digital system,
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Boost Volunteerism:
  </b>
  <span>
   Launch national campaigns to promote volunteering, integrate community service into education, maintain volunteer databases, and use digital platforms to connect volunteers with CSOs.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

  Conclusion

</h2>

<p>
 <span>
  Civil society remains the
 </span>
 <b>
  heartbeat of participatory democracy
 </b>
 <span>
  , bridging gaps between the state and citizens. Strengthening CSOs is not just about governance, it is about

  <b>
   Ensuring Accountability of Influencers:
  </b>
  <span>
   With the rise of
  </span>
  <b>
   influencer marketing
  </b>
  <span>
   , users are misled into financial risks by
  </span>
  <b>
   undisclosed paid promotions
  </b>
  <span>
   and
  </span>
  <b>
   illegitimate products
  </b>
  <span>

  <b>
   transparency, disclosure norms, and consumer protection
  </b>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Data Privacy &amp; Security:
  </b>
  <span>
   Social media platforms collect vast user data, often without informed consent, leading to
  </span>
  <b>
   privacy violations, surveillance, and misuse for profit or political influence
  </b>
  <span>
   . Regulation is essential to uphold

  </b>
  <span>
   While
  </span>
  <b>
   Article 19(1)(a)
  </b>
  <span>
   protects free speech, it is subject to
  </span>
  <b>
   reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2)
  </b>
  <span>
   (public order, morality, decency, security of the State). Regulation helps draw the line between

  </b>
  <span>

 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Key Challenges in Regulating Social Media in India?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Volume &amp; Anonymity:
  </b>
  <span>
   The
  </span>
  <b>
   sheer volume of online content
  </b>
  <span>
   makes continuous monitoring difficult. Added to this,
  </span>
  <b>
   anonymity of users
  </b>
  <span>
   emboldens hate speech, misinformation, and harmful content, straining regulatory capacity.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Transparency &amp; Accountability Gaps:
  </b>
  <span>
   Social media platforms lack
  </span>
  <b>
   transparency in decision-making
  </b>
  <span>
   and
  </span>
  <b>
   accountability in content moderation policies
  </b>
  <span>
   . The
  </span>
  <b>
   absence of independent oversight
  </b>
  <span>
   raises concerns about opaque practices and arbitrariness.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Defining Harmful Content:
  </b>
  <span>
   There is
  </span>
  <b>
   subjectivity in defining harmful content
  </b>
  <span>
   , as differing social, political, and cultural views complicate consensus. This ambiguity creates
  </span>
  <b>
   grey zones
  </b>
  <span>
   between legitimate expression and prohibited speech.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Free Speech vs. Censorship:
  </b>
  <span>
   Any attempt to regulate risks being seen as
  </span>
  <b>
   censorship
  </b>
  <span>
   or a
  </span>
  <b>
   curtailment of free speech
  </b>
  <span>
   , especially when criteria are not
  </span>
  <b>
   clear, objective, and proportionate
  </b>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Cross-Border Jurisdictional Issues:
  </b>
  <span>
   A large share of harmful content originates from
  </span>
  <b>
   outside India’s jurisdiction
  </b>
  <span>
   , making enforcement and regulation difficult under domestic law.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Political Neutrality Concerns:
  </b>
  <span>
   Content moderation decisions are often accused of
  </span>
  <b>
   political bias
  </b>
  <span>
   , raising questions about
  </span>
  <b>
   platform neutrality
  </b>
  <span>
   and undermining trust in regulatory mechanisms.
