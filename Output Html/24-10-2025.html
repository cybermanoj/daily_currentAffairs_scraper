  <span>
   This reversal is driven mainly by

  <b>
   up to 6 years.

  <span>
   Key climate extremes causing this include

  <b>
   rising temperatures, atmospheric dryness, and drought conditions.

   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  <b>
   1. What is a carbon sink?
   <br/>
  </b>
  <span>
   A carbon sink absorbs more CO₂ from the atmosphere than it releases, helping mitigate climate change. Examples include forests, oceans, and soils.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   2. What is a carbon source?
   <br/>
  </b>
  <span>
   A carbon source releases more CO₂ into the atmosphere than it absorbs, contributing to climate change. Examples include fossil fuel burning, wildfires, and deforestation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   3. What are the primary causes of the forest transition from sink to source?
   <br/>
  </b>
  <span>
   Increased tree mortality due to rising temperatures, droughts, atmospheric dryness (VPD), and cyclones.

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Simplified Rules:
  </b>
  <span>
   13 complex withdrawal provisions merged into
  </span>
  <b>
   three categories
  </b>
  <span>
   – essential needs (illness, education, marriage), housing, and special circumstances.

  </span>
  <b>
   both employee and employer contributions

   .
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Minimum Balance Rule:
  </b>
  <span>
   Members must maintain
  </span>
  <b>
   at least 25% of their contribution balance at all times
  </b>
  <span>
   , ensuring a financial cushion and long-term security.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Premature Withdrawal During Unemployment:
   <span>
    75% of PF can be withdrawn immediately after leaving a job.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Full 100% withdrawal allowed if unemployed for

  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Atomic Stenciling (The Masking):

    <b>
     Polymer Painting (The Patching):
