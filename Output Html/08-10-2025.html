<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Key Discoveries of the 2025 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Shimon Sakaguchi (Japan):
  </b>
  <span>
   Discovered the existence of
  </span>
  <b>
   regulatory T cells (Tregs)
  </b>
  <span>
   in 1995, showing that some
  </span>
  <b>
   T cells act as “immune system security guards”
  </b>
  <span>
   to prevent autoimmune attacks.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Mary Brunkow (USA) and Fred Ramsdell (USA):
  </b>
  <span>
   In 2001, identified that mutations in the FOXP3 gene caused a rare autoimmune disease (IPEX) in humans and similar
  </span>
  <b>
   immune dysfunctions in mice.
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Combined Contribution:
  </b>
  <span>
   Sakaguchi later discovered that the
  </span>
  <b>
   FOXP3 gene
  </b>
  <span>
   controls the development of
  </span>
  <b>
   regulatory T cells
  </b>
  <span>
   , explaining how the immune system maintains
  </span>
  <b>
   peripheral tolerance
  </b>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  Significance of Discoveries
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Cancer therapy
  </b>
  <span>
   : Targeting Tregs around tumors could make immune attacks on cancer cells more effective.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Autoimmune diseases
  </b>
  <span>
   : Boosting Tregs may prevent the immune system from attacking the body.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Transplantation
  </b>
  <span>
   : Better regulation of T cells reduces organ rejection.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  What are the Key Facts About the Human Immune System?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   About:
  </b>
  <span>
   The
  </span>
  <b>
   immune system
  </b>
  <span>
   is the body's defense mechanism against harmful invaders like
  </span>
  <b>
   pathogens
  </b>
  <span>
   (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites), as well as
  </span>
  <b>
   abnormal cells
  </b>
  <span>
   such as cancer cells.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     The immune system can be broadly divided into
    </span>
    <b>
     innate immunity
    </b>
    <span>
     and
    </span>
    <b>
     adaptive immunity
    </b>
    <span>
     .
    </span>
    <b>
    </b>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Innate Immunity (Non-Specific Defense):
   <span>
    It provides a rapid, generalized
   </span>
   response
   <span>
    against pathogens through physical barriers (skin, mucous membranes), phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils), and inflammation (helps isolate and destroy pathogens).
   </span>
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Adaptive Immunity (Specific Defense):
  </strong>
  <span>
   It provides a more targeted, specific response to pathogens and
  </span>
  <span>
   has a "memory" that enables the body to respond more efficiently if the same pathogen
  </span>
  <span>
   invades again.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Key elements include:
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       T-cells
      </strong>
      <span>
       <strong>
        :
       </strong>
       Part of the adaptive immune response,
      </span>
      <span>
       T-cells are a type of white blood cel
      </span>
      <span>
       l involved in recognizing and destroying infected cells.
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       B-cells
      </b>
      <span>
       : These cells produce antibodies (proteins) that specifically target and neutralize foreign antigens (e.g., viruses or bacteria).
      </span>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Immune Tolerance:
  </b>
  <span>
   The immune system
  </span>
  <b>
   must distinguish harmful invaders from the body’s own cells
  </b>
  <span>
   , maintaining self-tolerance to
  </span>
  <b>
   prevent autoimmune diseases
  </b>
  <span>
   (conditions where the body attacks its own tissues).
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Central Tolerance
  </b>
  <span>
   : This occurs in primary lymphoid organs such as the bone marrow and the thymus, where self-reactive immune cells (cells that could attack the body’s own tissues) are eliminated or rendered inactive.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Peripheral Tolerance
  </b>
  <span>
   : This involves mechanisms in the body’s tissues that prevent any remaining
  </span>
  <b>
   self-reactive cells from becoming active.
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are central to peripheral tolerance
    </b>
    <span>
     , ensuring that the immune system does not attack its own tissues.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
  </b>
  <b>
   Role of Regulatory T Cells (Tregs):
   <span>
    Tregs are a specialized subset of T-cells that act as
   </span>
   "peacekeepers" of the immune system
   <span>
    that suppress immune responses, helping to maintain immune tolerance.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     They are crucial in
    </span>
    <strong>
     preventing autoimmune diseases
    </strong>
    <span>
     <strong>
      .
     </strong>
     These cells help control immune responses to
    </span>
    <strong>
     avoid excessive inflammation and tissue damage
    </strong>
    <span>
     <strong>
      ,
     </strong>
     and they play a critical role in preventing autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.
