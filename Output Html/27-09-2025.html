<h2>
 <span>
  What Factors Limit the Effectiveness of Digital Reforms in Panchayati Raj Institutions?

  <span>
   , remote

  <b>

  <b>
   power outages

  <span>
   , inadequate

  <b>
   hardware (computers, printers)

  <b>
   broadband infrastructure

   <b>
    eGramSwaraj

 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Digital Literacy Gap:
  </b>
  <span>
   A significant portion of rural residents and elected
  </span>
  <b>
   representatives
  </b>
  <span>
   lack basic
  </span>
  <b>
   digital skills
  </b>
  <span>
   , limiting effective use of apps like

  <b>
   Meri Panchayat

  <span>

  <b>
   training
  </b>
  <span>

  <b>
   Panchayat secretaries
  </b>
  <span>
   and officials on complex
  </span>
  <b>
   platforms
  </b>
  <span>
   leads to errors or non-use.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Linguistic and Cultural Barriers:
  </b>
  <b>
   Language diversity
  </b>
  <span>
   and lack of support for
  </span>
  <b>
   local dialects
  </b>
  <span>
   may limit accessibility despite multi-language tools. Low
  </span>
  <b>
   awareness
  </b>
  <span>
   and
  </span>
  <b>
   resistance to change
  </b>
  <span>
   due to reliance on traditional methods hinder adoption of digital tools.

 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Implementation Hurdles:
  </b>
  <span>
   The effectiveness of
  </span>
  <b>
   Gram Manchitra
  </b>
  <span>
   relies on accurate

  <b>
   Gender Digital Divide

   Women

  <b>
   Remote Populations:

  <b>
   Reaching remote, and tribal,
  </b>
  <span>
   remains
  </span>
  <b>
   particularly difficult
  </b>
  <span>
   in India due to
  </span>
  <b>
   geographic isolation, weak health infrastructure, and high mobility of communities
  </b>
  <span>
   , which
  </span>
  <b>
   significantly limits the reach of routine immunisation services
  </b>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Especially in states like
    </span>
    <b>
     Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and parts of the Northeast
    </b>
    <span>
     .
    </span>

  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Vaccine Hesitancy:

  <b>
   Vaccine hesitancy

  <span>
   continues to persist in
  </span>
  <b>
   specific clusters
  </b>
  <span>

<h2>
 <span>
  What Measures can be Taken to Achieve Universal Immunization in India?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Strengthening National Immunization Days (NIDs):
  </b>
  <span>
   The success of initiatives like
  </span>
  <b>
   National Immunization Days (NIDs) should be replicated
  </b>
  <span>
   in other vaccination drives, ensuring that special campaigns, like the Pulse Polio program, reach every child, year after year.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Expanding Strategic Interventions:
   <span>
    Continued focus on
   </span>
   advocacy, social mobilization, interpersonal communication
   <span>
    at the family level, and media engagement needs to be intensified to raise awareness and drive higher immunization coverage.
   </span>
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Strengthening Task Forces at All Levels:
  </b>
  <span>
   Initiatives, such as
  </span>
  <b>
   strengthening State, District, and Block Task Forces on Immunization (STFI, DTFI, BTFI),
  </b>
  <span>
   should be further emphasized to ensure better coordination and effective program implementation across all regions.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Scaling Up Supplementary Immunization Campaigns:
   <span>
    More
   </span>
   extensive supplementary immunization campaigns
   <span>
    should be conducted in areas with low coverage to target
   </span>
   left-out and drop-out children
   <span>
    , as well as pregnant women, ensuring no one is left behind.
   </span>
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Enhancing Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHND):
  </strong>
  <span>
   Organizing more frequent and widespread VHNDs can ensure greater access to immunization services, particularly in remote and underserved villages.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Promoting Digital Tracking with UWIN Portal:
  </b>
  <span>
   Expanding the use of the
  </span>
  <b>
   UWIN portal
  </b>
  <span>
   for digital registration and tracking of vaccinations should be a priority to ensure accurate record-keeping and easy monitoring of immunization events.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 <span>
  Conclusion
 </span>
</h2>

<p>
 <b>
  India's Universal Immunization Programme
 </b>
 <span>
  is a
 </span>
 <b>
  global model in public health
 </b>
 <span>
  , showing remarkable progress through

 <b>
  strategic campaigns, digital innovations, and international collaborations

 <span>
  . Addressing remaining

   About:
  </b>
  <span>
   The
  </span>
  <b>
   WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies
  </b>
  <span>
   is a
  </span>
  <b>
   binding multilateral agreement
  </b>
  <span>
   , aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and fair trade in global fisheries.
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     It is the
    </span>
    <b>
     first WTO agreement focused on ocean governance and protecting marine resources
    </b>
    <span>
     . The agreement was adopted at

     <b>
      WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference in 2022
     </b>
    </a>
    <span>
     , under the
    </span>
    <b>
     Geneva Package
    </b>
    <span>
     ; it entered into force in September 2025 after two-thirds of WTO members deposited their acceptance instruments.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Key Objectives:
   <span>
    Prohibit subsidies that contribute to overfishing, overcapacity, and depletion of fish stocks.
   </span>
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span>
     Safeguard the livelihoods of millions dependent on fisheries for nutrition and income.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span>
     Provide a level playing field by disciplining subsidies that distort competition.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Key Features:
  </b>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Subsidy Prohibitions:
    </b>
    <span>
     Prohibits government support for illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, fishing of overfished stocks, and fishing on unregulated high seas.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Transparency Mechanism:
    </b>
    <span>
     WTO members must notify their subsidies and fishing activities for monitoring.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Implementation Support:
    </b>
    <span>
     The
    </span>
    <b>
     WTO Fish Fund
    </b>
    <span>
     was established to aid developing countries and
    </span>
    <b>
     Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
    </b>
    <span>
     by providing technical support and funding.
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Committee on Fisheries Subsidies:
    </b>
    <span>
     Provides a forum for regular dialogue, compliance review, and technical assistance.

<h2>
 <span>
  What is India’s Stance on WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies?
 </span>
</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>
   Protection for Small Fishers:
  </b>
  <span>
   India seeks
  </span>
  <b>
   policy space and exemptions
  </b>
  <span>
   to safeguard livelihoods of small-scale and artisanal fishers. India advocates for
  </span>
  <b>
   precise and effective Special and Differential Treatment (S&amp;DT)
  </b>
  <span>
   , including a
  </span>
  <b>
   25-year transition period
  </b>
  <span>
   for developing countries and LDCs, compared to 5–7 years proposed by developed nations.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Per Capita Subsidy Basis:
  </b>
  <span>
   India proposes that subsidy disciplines be calculated
  </span>
  <b>
   per fisher
  </b>
  <span>
   , not on total subsidy amounts, highlighting the disparity between high subsidies in developed countries (USD 76,000 per fisher)
  </span>
  <b>
   versus India (USD 35 per fisher).
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Stricter Rules for Historical Subsidisers:
  </b>
  <span>
   Calls for stricter rules targeting countries that have historically given high subsidies contributing to overfishing, while protecting nations with low-impact fisheries.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Sustainability Focus:
  </b>
  <span>
   Emphasizes that rules should
  </span>
  <b>
   not penalize nations working toward sustainable fishing
  </b>
  <span>
   and should support long-term marine conservation.
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>
